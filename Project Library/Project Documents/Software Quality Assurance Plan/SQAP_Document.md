## Introduction

### Purpose

The purpose of this Software Quality Assurance Plan (SQAP) is to define the quality assurance strategy, processes, and activities that will ensure the successful development, testing, and deployment of the ArtConnect application. This document outlines the quality assurance procedures to be followed throughout the software development lifecycle, from requirements gathering to post-deployment maintenance, ensuring that the software meets both customer and regulatory requirements.

### Scope

This SQAP applies to the development and delivery of the ArtConnect application, a social networking platform for artists. The plan covers quality assurance activities throughout the software development lifecycle, including requirements gathering, design, coding, testing, and deployment. This plan excludes hardware testing and external vendor software evaluations, which are covered by separate documentation.

### Concept of Operations

The application (ArtConnect) will be used by users with a limited amount of software knowledge and needs to be user-friendly and fail-proof. QA needs to verify and ensure that online services are easy to use and hard to break. Network services should be protected with end-to-end encryption. Network services need to have enough bandwidth to withstand large file transmissions without loss of quality.

### Contract Review

As per the contract [ArtConnect App](../Reference%20Document/ArtConnect%20App%20contract.pdf), we agree to provide services and assure a high-quality product to our client. Clients will present the product at the next convention and desire to have the product fully ready by that time period.
