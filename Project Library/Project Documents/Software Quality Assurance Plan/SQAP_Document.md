## Introduction
### Purpouse
The purpose of this Software Quality Assurance Plan (SQAP) is to define the quality assurance strategy,
processes, and activities that will ensure the successful development,testing, and deployment of the 
ArtConnect application. This document outlines the quality assurance procedures to be followed throughout
the software development lifecycle, from requirements gathering to post-deployment maintenance, ensuring
that the software meets both customer and regulatory requirements.
### Scope
This SQAP applies to the development and delivery of the ArtConnect application, a social networking platform 
for artists. The plan covers quality assurance activities throughout the software development lifecycle, including
requirements gathering, design, coding, testing, and deployment. This plan excludes hardware testing and external 
vendor software evaluations, which are covered by separate documentation.
### Concept of Operations
The application (ArtConnect) will be used by users with limited amount of software knowlege and needs to be user friendly
and fail prone. QA need to verify and make sure online serviced are easy to use and hard to make fail. Network services should
be protected with end-to-end encryption. Network services need to have enought bandtwidth to widstand large file transmission without loss of quality
